Download the file http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json. The example below uses "curl", but you can 
download with your web browser if you like. ("Zip codes" are the U.S. version of postal codes; they 
are 5 digits long.) Then import this file into a collection "zips".

    $ curl -O http://media.mongodb.org/zips.json

                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

    $
    $ # this is just informational for you:
    $ md5 zips.json
    MD5 (zips.json) = 4854d69c2ac389f334c0abff03d96259
    $
    $ # now import it ...


After import you will find 29467 documents in your zips collection -- note this is slightly different 
than the .json file as the zips.json file is a bit noisy in its data and has some duplicate keys 
(duplicate _id's):


    $ mongo
    > db.zips.count()
    29467
    
    
Question: consider the state with the 4th most zip codes in it. How many zip codes does that state have? 
Use the aggregation framework to query this.
