Homework: Homework 3.2

Use the same zips collection we imported in homework 3.1. You can confirm you have the right data 
(well, the count of documents at least) via:


    > db.zips.count()
    29467
Now use the aggregation framework to check the data quality. First let's check how many zip documents 
have a starting zip code digit of each possible character:


    > db.zips.aggregate( 
    ...   [
    ...     { $project : { _id : { $substr : ["$_id",0,1] } } } , 
    ...     { $group : { _id : "$_id", n : {$sum:1} } }
    ...   ]
    ... )
    {
    	"result" : [
    		{
    			"_id" : "5",
    			"n" : 3624
    		},
    		{
    			"_id" : "4",
    			"n" : 3387
    		},
    		{
    			"_id" : "6",
    			"n" : 3540
    		},
        â€¦
        
Now check in a similar manner the "city" field for its first character. You will find there are cities 
in the collection that start with a number -- which indicates either a noisy data set or zip codes that
have no corresponding city. Let's suppose we want to delete these zip code documents -- the ones that have 
a numeric city name -- from our data set. Do a remove operation to delete those documents.

After removing the documents indicated above, how many documents remain in the zips collection?
