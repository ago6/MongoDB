Homework: Homework 3.3

Download week3.js from the Download Handout link. Run this file in the shell to populate in the database 
of your choice a few documents in collections called:

  - policies
  - customers
  - staffers

(Note some of these may be used in future weeks.)
Once loaded, query each collection above and verify they are non-empty. In particular run:

      db.policies.find().pretty() 

to format the output of the one policy loaded nicely.
We have been asked to find all policies that are status!="expired", with liability coverage at or above 
$100. Note that current:true indicates the rate that is "current" and not historical.

The query to find those policies is which of the following?


ANS:+check+ db.policies.find( { status : { $ne : "expired" }, coverages : { $elemMatch : { type : "liability", 
rates : { $elemMatch : { rate : { $gte : 100 }, current : true } } } } } )

-- db.policies.find( { status : { $ne : "expired" }, coverages : { $elemMatch : { type : "liability",
rates : { rate : { $gte : 100 }, current : true } } } } )

-- db.policies.find( { status : { $ne : "expired" }, coverages : { type : "liability", rates : { 
$elemMatch : { rate : { $gte : 100 }, current : true } } } } )
