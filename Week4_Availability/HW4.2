Homework: Homework 4.2

Now convert the mongod instance (the one in the problem 4.1 above, which uses “--dbpath 1”) to a single 
server replica set. To do this, you’ll need to stop the mongod and restart it with “--replSet” on its 
command line. Give the set any name you like. 

Then go to the mongo shell. You should see some data in the week4 database. You can confirm with:

    > use week4
    > db.foo.find()

Once done with that run

     > homework.b()

in the mongo shell and enter that result.
