Homework: Homework 5.1

Start a mongod server instance (if you still have your replica set from week 4 running, that would work too).

Next, download week5.js and run:

    mongo --shell localhost/week5 week5.js
    > homework.init()
    >
Assume our app development team for a project would like to speed up the following query:

    db.sensor_readings.find( { 
     tstamp : { 
       $gte : ISODate("2012-08-01"), 
       $lte :  ISODate("2012-09-01") 
     },
     active : true
    } ).limit(3)
    
Run the query, and explain(). Then create an index to speed up the query (with ensureIndex()). Then run the 
explain() again and see that things have improved. When you have a solution run:

    homework.a()
    
and enter the result below.

Note: if you would like to try different indexes, you can use db.sensor_readings.dropIndexes() to drop your 
old index before creating a new one. (For this problem you will only need one index beyond the _id index 
which is present by default.)

Note: we are optimizing for the query when the limit clause is present. So be use to include limit when you 
call explain.
