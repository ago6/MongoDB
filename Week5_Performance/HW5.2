Homework: Homework 5.2

In a mongo shell run homework.b(). This will run in an infinite loop printing some output as it runs various 
statements against the server.

We'll now imagine that on this system a user has complained of slowness and we suspect there is a slow 
operation running. Find the slow operation and terminate it. (Keep the other shell with homework.b() going 
while this is happening). Once you have eliminated the slow operation, run

    homework.c()
    
and enter the output below. Once you have it right and are ready to move on, ctrl-c (terminate) the shell 
that is still running the homework.b() function.
