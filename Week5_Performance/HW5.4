Homework: Homework 5.4

In this problem you will demonstrate your ability to setup and utilize MMS monitoring for analyzing server 
load. We will provide a lightweight application to generate the load, and you, as the student, will monitor
it. 

Before you begin, you will need to have done each of the following (links provided for installation/signup 
pages): 

    1.Install Python (if not already installed)
    
    2.Install PyMongo. Either a) follow the "PyMongo Installation Process" lesson or b) follow the instructions 
      at api.mongodb.org
    
    3.Sign up for MMS Monitoring
    
    4.Install and run the MMS monitoring agent for your account. Either a) follow the instructions in the "MMS 
      Installation" lesson. or b) work through the MMS setup tutorial.

Once the monitoring agent is running, and you're seeing data in the MMS console, download mystery_client.py 
and run the mystery client, with the command python mystery_client.py. 

This question assumes that you are running on a standalone, or a single-node replica set. The presence of 
secondaries will affect your answer. 

How many update events are generated by the mystery_client.py each second that it is running?
