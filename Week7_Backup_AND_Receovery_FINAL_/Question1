Final: Question 1

Problems 1 through 3 are an exercise in running mongod's,replica sets,and an exercise in testing of replica 
set rollbacks, which can occur when a former primary rejoins a set after it has previously had a failure.

Get the a.sh and a.js files from Download Handout link. Use a.bat instead of a.sh on Windows.

Start a 3 member replica set (with default options for each member, all are peers). (a.sh will start the 
mongod's for you if you like.)

    $ # if on unix:
    $ chmod +x a.sh
    $ ./a.sh
    
Then run:

    $ mongo --shell --port 27003 a.js
    > // ourinit() will initiate the set for us.
    > // to see its source code type without the parentheses:
    > ourinit
    >
    > // now execute it:
    > ourinit()

We will now do a test of replica set rollbacks. This is the case where data never reaches a majority of the
set. We'll test a couple scenarios.

Take a look at the method testRollback() in a.js and what it does. Then, on localhost:27003, with that 
member primary, run:

    > testRollback()

Note:if 27003 is not primary, make it primary -- using rs.stepDown() (perhaps also rs.freeze()) for example.

At this point the mongod's on 27001 and 27002 are shut down. See the a.js source code. We now solely have 
our 27003 member running. If you wait a while, it will "step down" as it does not see a majority. 
Regardless, let's continue, no need to wait. First check that only one mongod is running:

    $ ps -A | grep mongod
    â€¦

Now, let's restart the two mongod's that are shut down. If you like you can cut and paste the two relevant
mongod invocations from a.sh.

Now run ps again and verify three are up:

    $ ps -A | grep mongod

Now, we want to see if any data that we attempted to insert isn't there. Go into the shell to any member of 
the set. Use rs.status() to check state. Be sure the member is "caught up" to the latest optime (if it's a 
secondary). Also on a secondary you might need to invoke rs.slaveOk() before doing a query.)

Now run:

    > db.foo.find()

to see what data is there after the set recovered from the two outages. How many documents do you have?
