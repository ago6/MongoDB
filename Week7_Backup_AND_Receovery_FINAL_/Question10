Final: Question 10

Now, for our temporary datamart, once again from a mongo shell connected to the cluster:


1) create an index {N2:1,mutant:1} for the snps.elegans collection. 
2) now run:
mongos> db.elegans.find({N2:"T",mutant:"A"}).limit(5).explain()
Based on the explain output, which of the following statements below are true?


      --No shards are queried.
      --1 shard is queried.
      ANS:+check+ 2 shards are queried.
      --5 documents are scanned.
      --7 documents are scanned.
      ANS:+check+ 10 documents are scanned.
      --Thousands of documents are scanned.
