Final: Question 5

Suppose we have blog posts in a (not sharded*) postings collection, of the form:

    {
      _id : …,
      author : 'joe',
      title : 'Too big to fail',
      text : …,
      tags : [ 'business', 'finance' ],
      when : ISODate("2008-11-03"),
      views : 23002,
      votes : 4,
      voters : ['joe', 'jane', 'bob', 'somesh'],
      comments : [
        { commenter : 'allan', 
          comment : 'Well, i don't think so…', 
          flagged:false, plus:2 },
        ...
      ]
    }

Which of these statements is true? Note: to get a multiple answer question right in this final you must 
get all the components right, so even if some parts are simple, take your time.

*Certain restrictions apply to unique constraints on indexes when sharded, so I mention this to be clear.


   ANS:+check+ We can create an index to make the query fast/faster:
      
      db.postings.find( { "comments.flagged" : true } )

    -- One way to assure people vote at most once per posting is to use this form of update:
    db.postings.update( 
        { _id:… }, 
        { $inc : {votes:1}, $push : {voters:'joe'} } );
        combined with an index on { voters : 1 } which has a unique key constraint.

   ANS:+check+ One way to assure people vote at most once per posting is to use this form of update:
      db.postings.update( 
        { _id:… , voters:{$ne:'joe'} },
        { $inc : {votes:1}, $push : {voters:'joe'} } );
