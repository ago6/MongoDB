Final: Question 11

Download problem11.json from the Download Handout link. Import it into a mongo database (the cluster from 
the last problem will work fine but an empty configuration will work as well):

      mongoimport -d snps -c problem11 problem11.json

Now, using the aggregation framework, answer the question: how many distinct N2/mutant pairs are there in 
this collection? (Assume the values as case sensitive - so 'a' and 'A' are different values for "distinctness"
purposes.)


ANS: 31
